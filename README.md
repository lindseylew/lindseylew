## 🚀Projects

## 🔍 Featured Project: Grid Monitoring & Anomaly Detection
A machine learning-based system that simulates power grid telemetry (voltage, current, frequency, and load), stores it in PostgreSQL, detects anomalies using Isolation Forest, and visualizes results in Power BI.

Key Features:
- Simulated telemetry data generation
- Anomaly detection via ML (Isolation Forest)
- Dockerized PostgreSQL & Python services
- Power BI dashboards for grid behavior
